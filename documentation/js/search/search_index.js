version ^5.0.0\nJava Development Kit: version 17.0.0\nAndroid Studio: version 2022.2.1 or greater\nAndroid SDK: API 31.0.0 or greater\n\n📦 Installation\nBuild the project from source:\n\nClone the dataquest repository:\n\nExample :❯ git clone https://github.com/programa-integral-de-fruticultura-5/dataquest\nNavigate to the project directory:\n\nExample :❯ cd dataquest\nInstall the required dependencies:\n\nExample :❯ npm install\nInstall Ionic CLI:\n\nExample :❯ npm install -g @ionic/cli🤖 Usage\nTo run the project, execute the following command:\nExample :❯ ionic capacitor run --listThis will list your available devices. Select the desired device and run the project:\nExample :❯ ionic capacitor run android --target= --prodIf you want to reload for every change made in code use the following command:\nExample :❯ ionic capacitor run android --target= --prod --livereload\n🤝 Contributing\nTo contribute to the project, please follow this guidelines\n\nAdd Form Validations\n\n\nAdd the new form: Add the form that will be validated in the src/app/models/FormDetai.namespace.ts file.\nExample :export enum FormType {\n  SPECIALIZED = 1,\n  SUPPORT = 5,\n  SUPPLY = 7,\n  PARCEL = 11,\n  PARCEL_SUPPLIES = 12,\n  GREENHOUSE = 13,\n  GREENHOUSE_SUPPLIES = 14,\n  PARCEL_SUPPORT = 15,\n  GREENHOUSE_SUPPORT = 16,\n  NEW_FORM = 20,    // Add the new form here (the end)\n}\nAdd the attribute to be validated: Add the attribute to the interfaces to be validated with the beneficiary (producer/association) in the src/app/models/Beneficiary.namespace.ts file.\nExample : export interface Producer {\n   cedula: string;\n   firstname: string;\n   middlename: string;\n   lastname: string;\n   secondLastname: string;\n   id: string;\n   specialized: boolean;\n   technicalAssistance: boolean;\n   demonstrationPlot: boolean;\n   supportDemonstrationPlot: boolean;\n   greenhouse: boolean;\n   supplies: boolean;\n   newAttribute: boolean;  // new attribute to be validated in the form\n   associationId: number;\n   transplantDate: string;\n   recommendedActions: SelectedQuestions\n   support: boolean; // Support visit / Technical Assistance\n   preloadedQuestions: PreloadedQuestion;\n }\n\n export const ProducerBaseParams = {\n   cedula: '',\n   firstname: '',\n   middlename: '',\n   lastname: '',\n   secondLastname: '',\n   id: '',\n   specialized: false,\n   technicalAssistance: false,\n   demonstrationPlot: false,\n   supportDemonstrationPlot: false,\n   greenhouse: false,\n   newAtribute: false,   // new attribute to be validated with the base value\n   supplies: false,\n   associationId: 0,\n   transplantDate: '',\n   recommendedActions: {},\n   support: false,\n   preloadedQuestions: {}\n };\n\n export type ProducerResponse = {\n   cedula: string;\n   primer_nombre: string;\n   segundo_nombre: string;\n   primer_apellido: string;\n   segundo_apellido: string;\n   identification: string;\n   has_especializada: number;\n   sost_p5: number;        // support visit\n   at_p5: number;          // asistencia técnica\n   pd_p5: number;          // parcela demostrativa\n   cm_p5: number;          // casa malla (invernadero espacial)\n   pd_at: number;          // parcela demostrativa asistencia técnica\n   insumo_p5: number;      // insumos\n   association_id: number; // id de la asociacion\n   transplantDate: string;\n   new_attribute: number;  // new attribute to be validated from the backend response\n   selectedQuestionIds: SelectedQuestions\n   QuestionPreloaded: PreloadedQuestion;\n };\nAdd the attribute to the builder: Add the attribute to the builder to be build when the response is fetched in the src/utils/builder.ts file.\nExample : export function producerBuilder(\n   producer: Beneficiary.ProducerResponse\n ): Beneficiary.Producer {\n   return {\n     cedula: producer.cedula,\n     firstname: producer.primer_nombre,\n     middlename: producer.segundo_nombre,\n     lastname: producer.primer_apellido,\n     secondLastname: producer.segundo_apellido,\n     id: producer.identification,\n     specialized: producer.has_especializada === 1,\n     technicalAssistance: producer.at_p5 === 1,\n     demonstrationPlot: producer.pd_p5 === 1,\n     supportDemonstrationPlot: producer.pd_at === 1,\n     newAttribute: producer.new_attribute === 1,   // new attribute to be validated\n     greenhouse: producer.cm_p5 === 1,\n     supplies: producer.insumo_p5 === 1,\n     associationId: producer.association_id,\n     transplantDate: producer.transplantDate,\n     recommendedActions: producer.selectedQuestionIds,\n     support: producer.sost_p5 === 1,\n     preloadedQuestions: producer.QuestionPreloaded\n   };\n }\nAdd the new form to the switch case: Add the new form to the switch case in the src/app/services/detailed-form.service.ts file.\nExample : private canSetBeneficiary(\n   selectedBeneficiary: Beneficiary.Producer\n ): boolean | undefined {\n   const formId = this.selectedForm.id;\n\n   switch (formId) {\n     case FormDetail.FormType.SPECIALIZED:\n       return this.canSetSpecializedBeneficiary(selectedBeneficiary);\n     case FormDetail.FormType.SUPPORT:\n       return true; /* this.canSetSupportBeneficiary(selectedBeneficiary) */\n     case FormDetail.FormType.SUPPLY:\n       return this.canSetSupplyBeneficiary(selectedBeneficiary);\n     case FormDetail.FormType.PARCEL:\n     case FormDetail.FormType.PARCEL_SUPPLIES:\n       return this.canSetParcelBeneficiary(selectedBeneficiary);\n     case FormDetail.FormType.GREENHOUSE:\n     case FormDetail.FormType.GREENHOUSE_SUPPLIES:\n     case FormDetail.FormType.GREENHOUSE_SUPPORT:\n       return this.canSetGreenhouseBeneficiary(selectedBeneficiary);\n     case FormDetail.FormType.PARCEL_SUPPORT:\n       return this.canSetParcelSupportBeneficiary(selectedBeneficiary);\n     case FormDetail.FormType.NEW_FORM:  // Add the new form here\n       return this.canSetNewFormBeneficiary(selectedBeneficiary);\n     default:\n       return true;\n   }\n }\nCreate the method: Create the method to validate the new attribute and its alert in the src/app/services/detailed-form.service.ts file. Take the example with the greenhouse form. Do not forget to modify the alert message.\nExample : private canSetGreenhouseBeneficiary(selectedBeneficiary: Beneficiary.Producer): boolean {\n   const isGreenhouseBeneficiary: boolean = selectedBeneficiary.greenhouse;\n\n   if (isGreenhouseBeneficiary) {\n     return true;\n   } else {\n     this.showNoGreenhouseBeneficiaryAlert();\n     return false;\n   }\n }\n\n private async showNoGreenhouseBeneficiaryAlert(): Promise {\n   const alert = await this.alertController.create({\n     header: 'Beneficiario no es candidato de casa malla',\n     message: 'Escoge otro beneficiario',\n     buttons: ['OK'],\n   });\n   await alert.present();\n }\nChange the version name and code: Change the version name and code in the android\\app\\build.gradle file.\nExample : android {\n   ...\n   defaultConfig {\n     applicationId \"com.corpovalle.app\"\n     minSdkVersion rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion\n     targetSdkVersion rootProject.ext.targetSdkVersion\n     versionCode 90 \n     versionName \"1.12.25\"\n     testInstrumentationRunner \"androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner\"\n     ...\n   }\n }\nversionCode: An integer value that represents the version of the application code, relative to other versions. Change the version code +1 each time you want to release a new version independently of the environment (otherwise the app will not update and will show an error on the deploy)\nversionName: A string value that represents the version of the application, shown to users. Change the version name each time you want to release a new version in the form mayor.minor.patch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributor Graph\n\n\n   \n      \n
